        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Education is the process of facilitating learning, or the acquisition of knowledge, skills, values, morals, beliefs, habits, and personal development. Educational methods include teaching, training, storytelling, discussion and directed research. Education frequently takes place under the guidance of educators; however, learners can also educate themselves. Education can take place in formal or informal settings, and any experience that has a formative effect on the way one thinks, feels, or acts may be considered educational. The methodology of teaching is called pedagogy.Most children get their education from going to school, and school creates a really good routine for them. There is plenty of evidence suggesting that routine is really important for children, giving them a sense of purpose, stability and safety. 

            Having a routine like going to school also teaches children to get used to schedules, become more independent, and look forward to different parts of their day.

        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Proper and good education is very important for all of us. It facilitates quality learning all through the life among people of any age group, cast, creed, religion and region. It is the process of achieving knowledge, values, skills, beliefs, and moral habits. People need to get high level awareness about the importance of knowledge more than before. Education is very necessary for each and everyone in order to improve knowledge, way of living as well as social and economic status throughout the life. Getting proper education is the birth rights of everyone restricting which is the crime. Education is the ultimate way to get victory over all the personal and social problems.Early childhood education is really important for a child’s brain development, and it also helps them to learn vital social and mental skills early on in life. An analysis of the benefits of preschool on children found that 7-8 out of 10 children who went to preschool performed better in intelligence and academic achievement than those who did not.

            Another study found that students who were given high quality early education performed better than their control group in many areas, including academic tests, attendance rates, behaviour and emotional maturity.  </p>
